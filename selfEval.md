# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Fairly confident. I feel like a day or so more and it will be rote memory.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Same as before. I learned them back to back.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
If statements are easy. They are a throwback to Uni Logic courses
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Everything is taking longer than expected, but within a 1.5 hour range. I planned on an hour.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I will adjust my calendar to add more time to organize my notes. Reference is key!
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
So far I am clear on how I got here. It may be slow moving to prove it for a bit longer. But I am confident it can be done.
