// Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable that stores a Number. 
// The program should print out the String "even" if the Number is even, and the String "odd" 
// if the Number is odd. Hint: You may need to do some extra research on the remainder operator 
// (%) to solve this challenge.

var number = 333335
if(number % 2===0){

    console.log("The number is even")
}
else{
    console.log("The number is odd")
}
